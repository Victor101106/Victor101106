# About Me
Hello World! I'm Victor Gabriel. I have been passionate about technology since I was a child, I started my contact at eleven years old when I made mods for the Minecraft Pocket Edition game using JavaScript language. I am currently attending the second year of the technical course in informatics at the Federal Institute of Maranh√£o, where I have already learned a lot of content about computing and continue to learn more every day.

### Projects

  <summary><strong>Checkers Warriors</strong></summary>
  Checkers Warriors was an idea that came up with a group of friends that I decided to make a reality. In short, this is a checkers game with pixelated visuals and a soundtrack based on my favorite music style, Hard Rock. For this game I want to add all possible configurations of existing checkers around the world in addition to adding new game modes that may include powers or abilities that would enhance the gameplay.

  <summary><strong>Trick or Treat</strong></summary>
  Trick-or-Treat was a small project developed for my institute's Halloween event for a dynamic game, in which each person would have a single chance to randomly choose an option. In the case of the good option, the person would win some sweets, but in the case of the bad option, the person would pay a challenge chosen by the judge.

### Skills
I currently work as a web developer, in which I mainly use HTML, CSS, JS/TS and other key technologies for development, such as NodeJS, MongoDB and Git. Also, I'm studying architectures and concepts like Clean Architecture, Clean Code and UI/UX.

In my course I studied several technologies, initially I studied the concepts of algorithms and pseudo-codes. Already in my second semester I started studying the C language and sorting algorithms. I am currently studying the Java language in order to better understand OOP and SQL for a better understanding of relational databases.

During most of my time as a developer I programmed in VBA (Visual Basic for Application) making PowerPoint games for fun. So with that time I acquired a great experience about the language both in PowerPoint and in Excel. During that time I developed some important projects for me, such as: Ray Casting, QuadTree and some utility modules.
