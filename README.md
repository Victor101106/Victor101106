# About Me
Hello World! I'm Victor Gabriel. I have been passionate about technology since I was a child, I started my contact at eleven years old when I made mods for the Minecraft Pocket Edition game using JavaScript language. I am currently attending the second year of the technical course in informatics at the Federal Institute of Maranh√£o, where I have already learned a lot of content about computing and continue to learn more every day.

  <summary><strong>Checkers Warriors</strong></summary>
  Checkers Warriors was an idea that came up with a group of friends that I decided to make a reality. In short, this is a checkers game with pixelated visuals and a soundtrack based on my favorite music style, Hard Rock. For this game I want to add all possible configurations of existing checkers around the world in addition to adding new game modes that may include powers or abilities that would enhance the gameplay.

  <summary><strong>Trick or Treat</strong></summary>
  Trick-or-Treat was a small project developed for my institute's Halloween event for a dynamic game, in which each person would have a single chance to randomly choose an option. In the case of the good option, the person would win some sweets, but in the case of the bad option, the person would pay a challenge chosen by the judge.
